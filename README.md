## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is the first coding challenge for CF 401 class.

Here I write a programe with following features:
  * When run, the program should print an intro message and the menu for the restaurant
  * The restaurantâ€™s menu should include appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages. At least 3 in each category
  * The program should prompt the user for an order
  * When a user enters an item, the program should print an acknowledgment of their input
  * The program should tell the user how to exit


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
in Terminal, go to the directory, and then type in "python snake_cafe.py" to run the code.


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
This code is written in python 3.6 with all default functions (no library import required.)


## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
No API available right now.
